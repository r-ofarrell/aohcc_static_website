          <h1>Lauren Madden, LPC-A</h1>
          <p>
            Lauren is a licensed professional counseling associate, having
            received her Master of Science in Clinical Counseling in 2023. She
            integrates a psychodynamic perspective with techniques from
            cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy,
            as well as interventions from dialectical behavioral therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lauren works with adults and adolescents and implements a­ creative
            and adaptive approach to therapy, viewing therapy as both an art and
            a science. She offers clients unconditional acceptance and a safe,
            compassionate space to process their life experiences and pain, all
            while creating a collaborative counseling partnership. Years of
            travel experiences have given Lauren an appreciation for cultural
            diversity and heightened her belief in the importance of providing
            culturally adaptive treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her clinical training, Lauren gained experience working at
            nearly all levels of clinical care, serving in settings ranging from
            private practices to inpatient hospitals. This diversity of clinical
            experience has enabled Lauren to work effectively with a range of
            presenting concerns, including: depression, anxiety, PTSD and other
            trauma related difficulties, low self-esteem, religious trauma, and
            life transitions. She considers it a privilege to be present with
            her clients and to facilitate their exchanging confusion and pain
            for clarity, self-knowledge, freedom, and health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lauren greatly enjoys traveling with her husband and staying active
            with walks through the Lowcountry and Pilates. She channels her
            passion for art into drawing, music, writing, and photography, among
            other creative pursuits. Her mischievous Yorkshire Terrier’s
            interruptions to her art projects are helpful for reminding her to
            do things like eat and sleep.
