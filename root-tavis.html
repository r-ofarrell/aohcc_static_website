          <h1>Tavis Root, LPC</h1>
          <p>
            Tavis comes from a long line of individuals who have worked in
            various areas of human services. Ranging from military service and
            law enforcement, to teachers, farmers, machinists and more.
            Originally from Michigan, Tavis has lived in several different
            states over the course of his life, including North Carolina,
            Kentucky, Colorado and Indiana before moving to South Carolina with
            his wife in 2022. Tavis received his bachelor’s degree in
            Psychopathology from City University of New York in 2019 and his M.A
            in Clinical and Mental Health Counseling from Indiana Wesleyan
            University in 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tavis has worked with individuals 17-years-old and up in areas of
            trauma, grief, anxiety and depression. Tavis has specialized
            training in Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR),
            which is an evidenced-based treatmetn for posttraumatic stress
            disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related difficulties. Additionally,
            he is nearing the completion of two certifications as an Autism
            Spectrum Disorder Clinical Specialist (ASDCS) and ADHD-Certified
            Clinical Services Provider (ADHD-CCSP). These trainings allow him to
            provide specialized services to neuro-diverse individuals in helping
            them to understand their specific brain functions and navigate the
            complexities of their environment, personal perceptions, and
            psychological needs, something which is a true passion point for
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tavis’ therapeutic approach is one of warm active listening, working
            to create an environment where you feel as though you can express
            yourself and communicate and be true who you are and your specific
            needs. Using his clinical background and personal life experiences,
            Tavis helps his clients navigate the complexity of daily life to
            achieve their goals and become the person they want to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his spare time Tavis spends time with his wife and their cats
            Ki-Ki and Stella. Tavis’ faith in God has been a source of strength
            throughout his life. He enjoys studying languages, cultures, and
            history, something spurred on by his own Irish and German
            background. Tavis likewise holds a passion for baseball
            (specifically the Phillies!), video games and Japanese anime along
            with his own creative and artistic pursuits.
