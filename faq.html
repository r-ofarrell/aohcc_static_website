        <section class="faq">
          <h2>How long does therapy take?</h2>
          <p>
            The answer is: it depends. The length of therapy can vary greatly
            and depends on a number of factors. Some of those factors include:
            how significant the presenting issues are, how long-standing the
            presenting issues are, how much a person is able to invest in the
            therapeutic process, as well as what supports and resources the
            person has access to. Additionally, some people come to therapy,
            accomplish their initial therapeutic goals, but decide to stay in
            therapy for a longer period of time because they see the benefit of
            engaging in therapy for their overall health and well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all of that said, what you can initially expect in therapy is
            that your therapist will thoroughly assess your presenting
            difficulties, a process that typically takes 1-4 sessions. After the
            assessment, your therapist will clarify what your initial
            therapeutic goals are, collaborate with you in developing a
            personalized treatment plan, and give a time frame (typically 8-12
            sessions) of when you and your therapist can check-back in to
            reassess your progress in therapy and reformulate therapeutic goals
            as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, if you would like to end therapy for any reason, you can
            do so at anytime. If you are having concerns about your progress in
            therapy or about the direction of therapy, we would encourage you to
            share your concerns with your therapist. This provides your
            therapist the opportunity to hear your questions and concerns and
            change the approach to your therapy if needed. Additionally, it
            provides you and your therapist an opportunity to explore whether a
            referral for additional or alternative services would be beneficial
            to you.

          <h2>Is therapy effective?</h2>
          <p>
            Research has consistently shown that the majority of those who
            participate in therapy experience at least some improvement in
            symptoms. With that said, a number of factors can contribute to the
            effectiveness (or lack thereof) of therapy. Some of these factors
            include how long-standing and complex a particular issue is and
            whether there are evidenced-based treatments for that particular
            concern. Additionally, most therapies require the active engagement
            and participation on the part of the client. This participation
            often includes utilizing, outside of therapy, skills and strategies
            learned in therapy. Additionally, research has identified a set of
            factors, called, "common factors," that also impact the
            effectiveness of therapy. Some "common factors" include: how
            comfortable, safe, and understood you feel with your therapist; how
            well you and your therapist are able to develop an agreed upon
            conceptualization of your difficulties; how clear and specific the
            goals you and your therapist establish for therapy are; what
            resources and supports you have available (such as social support,
            community supports, financial support, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, there are a lot of variables that go into whether any
            specific course of therapy will be effective and while most people
            experience at least some benefits from therapy, unfortunately we
            cannot guarantee that you personally will benefit from therapy. What
            we can promise is that each therapist at AOHCC will support you,
            collaborate with you, and use their clinical expertise to try and
            find solutions that work for you. Additionally, if your therapist
            feels you would be better served by a different type of treatment or
            service, your therapist will discuss this with you and will seek to
            connect you with any such service that could be beneficial to you.

          <h2>How much does therapy cost?</h2>
          <ul id="therapy-rates">
            <li>Individual psychotherapy (55 min.): $150</li>
            <li>Couple psychotherapy (55 min.): $175</li>
            <li>Family psychotherapy* (55 min.): $175</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Payment is due at the start of your appointment. To simplify billing
            for yourself and your therapist, we will, with your consent, obtain
            a credit card to keep on file that will be charged for your
            appointments.
          </p>
          <p id="therapy-rates-note">
            *Please note that all appointments with persons under the age of 18
            are billed at the family psychotherapy rate.

        </section>
        <section class="faq">
          <h2>What are appointments like?</h2>
          <p>
            This will vary depending on what your therapeutic goals are and what
            treatment approach your therapist employs. In general, here are some
            of the things you can expect to happen during appointments:
          </p>
          <ol id="therapy-bullets">
            <li>
              Your therapist may assist you in exploring your thoughts,
              feelings, and behaviors in response to past, present, or upcoming
              challenges in your life. By exploring your thoughts, feelings, and
              behaviors, you can gain insight into what is most troublesome to
              you, what is hindering your efforts to resolve what is troubling
              you, and how you might more effectively respond to what is
              troubling you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your therapist may introduce or review information that is
              relevant to the achievement of your therapeutic goals. This
              information could relate to a particular diagnosis, to factors
              that contribute to a specific problem or experience, and to
              information about a specific treatment approach that could be
              beneficial for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your therapist may introduce you to and guide you through specific
              exercises that could be helpful to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              You and your therapist may review and build upon exercises you
              were given to do outside of your appointment. While a lot of
              progress can be made in your therapy appointments, the bulk of
              your therapeutic progress will be based on the work you do outside
              of therapy.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="faq">
          <h2>What can I expect in my relationship with my therapist?</h2>
          <p>
            You can expect a personal, warm, but professional relationship with
            your therapist. This means that during appointments, you can expect
            to feel heard, understood, respected, and safe with your therapist,
            even when your therapist if offering feedback to you. You can also
            expect that the primary focus of the relationship will be on you and
            on your goals. This means that while your therapist may share
            personal information, that information will be shared with a
            therapeutic goal in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we want you to know that all of our therapists operate
            according to the legal and ethical guidelines set by their
            respective licensing boards and professional organizations, such as
            the American Psychological Association (APA), the American
            Counseling Association (ACA), and the National Association of Social
            Workers (NASW). These licensing boards and professional
            organizations set guidelines for relationships with clients in order
            to protect you and ensure that therapy stays focused on what is
            beneficial for you, the client. According to these guidelines,
            therapists cannot have any social interactions with a client for at
            least 5 years after the termination of treatment. Additionally,
            under no circumstances can therapists engage in a romantic and/or
            sexual relationship with any current or past client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the Lowcountry can be a small community and you may on
            occasion run into your therapist while out in the community. If this
            happens, your therapist will not initiate contact with you. This is
            done in order to protect your confidentiality, as it could be
            awkward or uncomfortable for a friend or family member to ask how
            you know your therapist. You are of course free to initiate contact
            with your therapist and introduce your therapist to anyone you want
            to. But please know that any such interactions with your therapist
            will be kept brief and that your therapist will not engage in any
            therapeutic conversations (including discussing therapy-related
            matters) during such encounters in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also expect that your therapist will continue to pursue
            additional training and supervision in order to further develop and
            grow as a therapist. Some trainings require that a participating
            therapist record sessions with some clients so that the therapist
            can receive feedback on the implementation of the specific
            therapeutic approach or technique. Should your therapist engage in
            (or already be engaged in) such a training and want to record some
            sessions with you, your therapist will discuss this with you,
            provide you with information about how any recordings will be used,
            stored, and destroyed, and will answer any questions or concerns you
            may have. Your therapist will not record any session, in any way
            (audio or video) without your express written consent. Should you
            provide such written consent, you can withdraw your consent at any
            time by talking to your therapist about your desire to withdraw your
            consent to record sessions and by providing a written notice
            thereof. We also ask that you agree to not record sessions in any
            way (audio or video) without your therapist's express written
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these boundaries are meant to promote a sense of safety and
            comfort for both you and your therapist, so that therapy can remain
            focused on your goals and can be as effective as possible.

          <h2>How can I contact my therapist between appointments?</h2>
          <p>
            You can call your therapist at the work number your therapist
            provides you or you may call the main office at (843) 377-5322.
            Please note that our therapists at Anchors of Hope Counseling Center
            do not provide emergency or crisis related services. If you are
            experiencing an emergency or crisis, please call 911 or go to your
            nearest Emergency Room. If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts,
            feelings, and/or urges, you may also call the National Suicide
            Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your therapist will check their voicemail during regular office
            hours, Monday through Friday and will attempt to return your call
            within 1 business day. Phone calls between you and your therapist
            that go beyond scheduling related matters may be charged a phone
            consultation fee, which is $35 per 15-minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also send your therapist a message through our secure client
            portal. Please note that email is not a secure medium for contacting
            your therapist and as such, we strongly encourage you to message
            your therapist through the client portal. If you do decide to email
            your therapist, please only do so for scheduling purposes; do not
            share any information through email that you want kept confidential.

          <h2>What do I do if I am experiencing an emergency or crisis?</h2>
          <p>
            Anchors of Hope Counseling Center does not provide emergency or
            crisis related services. If you are experiencing an emergency or
            crisis, please call 911 or go to your nearest Emergency Room. If you
            are experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings, and/or urges, you may
            also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="faq">
          <h2>Will what I say in therapy stay confidential?</h2>
          <p>
            In general the answer is yes. Therapy works best when there is trust
            that you can share (if you choose) your most private thoughts and
            feelings without worrying that someone else will learn about them.
            It is the legal and ethical duty of all of our therapists to
            strictly guard and protect what you share in therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is important for you to know that there are some
            circumstances where confidentiality can or must be broken. Most of
            these circumstances involve situations where yourself or another
            person may be in physical danger and we as therapists are required,
            by law, to report the potential danger so that law enforcement and
            other state agencies can do their work of keeping others safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we want you to have a clear sense of what information will
            remain confidential and what information we need to report, we have
            created a separate handout on confidentiality that talks about
            confidentiality in more depth. This handout is included in your
            intake paperwork, but we also include it on our website so that if
            you ever forget what is on there, you can reference it there. Please
            read it over carefully and if you have any further questions about
            confidentiality in therapy, please do not hesitate to speak to your
            therapist or call our office.
