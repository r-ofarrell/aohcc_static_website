          <h1>Carly Polk, LPC</h1>
          <p>
            Carly is a Licensed Professional Counselor in the state of South
            Carolina. She obtained her Masters of Arts degree in Clinical

          <p>
            Upon graduating with her Masters degree in Clinical Counseling,
            Carly went straight into working at a child advocacy center as a
            Child and Family Therapist and Forensic Interviewer. During her time
            at the child advocacy center, Carly implemented a variety of trauma
            treatments with children, adolescents, and adults. In 2023 Carly
            transitioned to the Medical University of South Carolinaâ€™s National
            Crime Victim Research and Treatment Center where she worked with
            adolescents with trauma and substance use disorders while also
            supporting their families. Carly primarily operates from a cognitive
            behavioral lens and has been trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
            (CBT), Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT),
            Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
            with Problematic Sexual Behaviors for Adolescents (CBT-PSB-A),
            Written Exposure Therapy (WET), and Risk Reduction Through Family
            Therapy (RRFT). Carly also has experience working with children on
            the autism spectrum, individuals with depression, anxiety, body
            image and self-esteem related issues, and adjustment related
            difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            During her free time Carly enjoys hanging out with her family and
            friends and reading!
