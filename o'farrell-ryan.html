          <h1>Ryan O'Farrell, Psy.D.</h1>
          <p>
            Ryan is a Clinical Psychologist who earned his doctorate in clinical
            psychology in 2016 from George Fox University in Newberg, Oregon.
            Prior to starting Anchors of Hope Counseling, LLC, in 2023 with his
            colleague Jacquie Atkins, LPC, he served as the Clinical Director of
            Life Resources in Mount Pleasant, SC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ryan's graduate training provided him the opportunity to start
            working with clients in 2012 and since that time he has had the
            honor and pleasure of assisting individuals with a breadth of
            personal concerns, including depression, anxiety, PTSD and other
            trauma-related difficulties, insomnia, panic attacks, men's issues,
            identity issues, and relationship problems. He has additional
            training in EMDR, which is an evidence-based treatment for PTSD and
            other trauma-related difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ryan's therapeutic approach is warm, empathic, and highly
            relational. He has been heavily influenced by Emotion-Focused
            Therapy, an evidence-based treatment that emphasizes empathic
            attunement to a person's emotions and needs. While Ryan incorporates
            a number of different treatment approaches into his therapy (such as
            CBT, ACT, and EMDR), his primary goal is ensure that each individual
            he sees feels heard, understood, and respected throughout the
            therapy process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ryan has been in the Charleston region since 2017. He grew up in the
            San Francisco Bay area and prior to moving to South Carolina, also
            lived in Oregon and Washington state. He loves quiet evenings spent
            reading and drinking tea and is an avid sports fan, especially of
            the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden State Warriors. When moving
            to South Carolina, he made a personal commitment to remain like
            Switzerland when it comes to the USC and Clemson rivalry; he is
            happy to say he has kept that commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ryan and his wife Chelsea have been married for 14 years and have an
            ever expanding flock of young children. As such, he has no quiet
            evenings to read and drink tea.
