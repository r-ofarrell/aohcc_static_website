          <h1>Sydney Reynolds, LPC</h1>
          <p>
            Sydney graduated from Webster University with her master’s degree in
            Professional Mental Health Counseling and she earned her bachelor’s
            degree in psychology from the University of South Carolina-Upstate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through her work with a child advocacy center, she gained experience
            and extensive training in providing counseling services for
            children, adolescents, and adults who have experienced trauma and
            abuse. She has training in evidence-based approaches to address
            problematic sexual behavior in pre-school and school-aged children
            and she has a passion for teaching body safety, internet safety, and
            sex education to children, adolescents, and parents. Sydney loves to
            work with parents and their children to strengthen communication,
            improve connection, and build healthy relationships that last a
            lifetime. In a world where conflict seems to create division all
            around us, Sydney strives to help parents and their children (of all
            ages) navigate differences in values or beliefs while maintaining a
            loving, trusting relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sydney’s primary therapeutic tools include Cognitive Behavioral
            Therapy (CBT), Trauma-Focused CBT, Cognitive Processing Therapy
            (CPT), and Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT). She also
            draws from concepts within attachment theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her spare time, Sydney and her family love to serve alongside
            their local church, explore outdoors, and relax at the beach.
