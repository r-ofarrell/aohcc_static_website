        <h1>Use your insurance benefits</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>Out-of-network benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Many therapists choose to not get panelled with insurance. There are
            a host of reasons for this. For many therapists, the desire to
            provide the best treatment to clients conflicts with the reality of
            an insurance provider determining how long treatment can last and
            what sort of treatments can be used. Yet it is also true is that
            therapy is not cheap and using one's insurance benefits can make the
            difference between being able to attend therapy regularly and not
            being able to attend at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            What many people don't realize is that many insurance plans include
            out-of-network benefits, which allows individuals to obtain mental
            health (and other medical) services by an out-of-network provider
            and receive reimbursement for those services. Typically, a person
            who wants to use their out-of-network benefits will pay the full fee
            for the services they receive and ask their mental health care
            provider for a superbill, which the person will submit to their
            insurance provider. If the insurance provider accepts the
            out-of-network claim they will reimburse the person in accordance
            with their out-of-network benefits. At AOHCC, you can ask our
            adminstrative team or your therapist for a superbill if you would
            like to utilize your out-of-network mental health benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very important to note that you should verify with your
            insurance provider that you do have out-of-network mental health
            benefits before you seek to submit an out-of-network insurance
            claim. Please be aware that insurance providers will only pay for
            services rendered by a fully licensed therapist or psychologist.
            Additionally, insurance providers will not reimburse for couples
            therapy (unless one person in the couple is designated as the
            "identified client," given a diagnosis, and then couples therapy is
            focused on remediating the identified client's diagnosis, a practice
            we don't do at AOHCC!). As such, if you are seeking couples therapy
            or are seeing an LPC-A at AOHCC, you will not be able to use your
            insurance benefits (whether in-network or out-of-network) for any
            services your receive.

          <h2>In-network benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Each therapist at Anchors of Hope Counseling Center is an
            independent contractor who chooses to partner with us. As such, each
            therapist makes the decision about which insurance providers (if
            any) to become panelled with. We know that for many, being able to
            use your insurance benefits is absolutely essential when seeking out
            mental health services. That is why, in the
            <a href="./index.html#therapist-header"
              >"Therapists" section of our homepage</a
            >, we have listed under each individual therapist what insurances
            that therapist accepts. Please note that while we hope this way of
            highlighting what insurance each provider accepts makes finding the
            right therapist much easier, it is very important that you verify
            your insurance benefits prior to seeing any provider (whether at
            AOHCC or elsewhere).
          </p>

            For those wanting to utilize their Medicare benefits, please note
            that unfortunately none of our providers accepts Medicare.
