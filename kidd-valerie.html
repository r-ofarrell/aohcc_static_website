          <h1>Valerie Kidd, LPC-A</h1>
          <p>
            Valerie is a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate (LPC-A) in
            the state of South Carolina and a Nationally Certified Counselor
            (NCC). She earned her Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health
            Counseling from Liberty University and Bachelor of Arts in
            Psychology from West Virginia State University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Valerie has training working with families, children, individuals,
            and couples. She has spent the last year working with children and
            families at a children’s advocacy center and charter school. During
            this time, Valerie was certified in Trauma Focused Cognitive
            Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), an evidenced-based treatment for
            children who have experienced trauma. Prior to entering the mental
            health field, Valerie worked in accounting and finance for more than
            10 years. Her experiences in accounting and finance gave her a deep
            understanding of how occupational stressors such as long hours,
            heavy workload, and workplace conflict can have negative impacts on
            mental and physical wellness. She enjoys assisting clients in
            developing healthy professional boundaries, self-care plans, and
            (when necessary) career transitions plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a therapist, Valerie takes a person-centered approach that allows
            space for the client to move at their own pace. She has a passion
            for helping clients realize that their past does not define their
            future. Valerie’s favorite quote by the late and great Maya Angelou
            is, “You did what you knew how to do and when you knew better, you
            did better.” No matter where you are on your journey, she is honored
            to walk alongside you to provide a safe, non-judgemental space for
            processing and healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Valerie, along with her husband Jeramy and children, have lived in
            the Lowcountry for the past 7 years. She is passionate about
            spending time with her family and enjoys hiking, waterfalls,
            traveling, and roller-skating (bonus points if the DJ plays 80’s and
            90’s hits).
