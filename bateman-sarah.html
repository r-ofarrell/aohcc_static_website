          <h1>Sarah Bateman, LPC-A</h1>
          <p>
            Sarah is a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate in South
            Carolina who received her M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling
            from Charleston Southern University. She also holds a B.S. in
            Psychology from Columbia International University.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a therapist, Sarah particularly enjoys walking alongside those
            who are experiencing depression, anxiety, and relationship
            difficulties. Additionally, Sarah has a passion for helping
            individuals who have experienced trauma move toward healing and
            wholeness. She is trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and
            Reprocessing (EMDR) and she uses it as a tool to help people process
            troubling past life events so they can find freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sarah seeks to provide a safe, welcoming place for people to find
            rest from the burdens they carry. Her approach is collaborative,
            warm, and attachment-based. A major priority for her in treatment is
            to ensure that each individual feels deeply heard and understood.
          </p>
          <p>
            A native of Charleston, Sarah has only taken brief breaks from her
            hometown, going away to Columbia for undergrad and spending a year
            and a half in Tanzania. Her brief stints away from Charleston have
            confirmed for her that she cannot stay away from the ocean for too
            long! Aside from basking in the rays at the beach, she enjoys
            traveling, spending time with her many nieces and nephews, and swing
            dancing in her free time.
