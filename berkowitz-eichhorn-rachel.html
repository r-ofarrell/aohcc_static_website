          <h1>Rachel Berkowitz Eichhorn, LPC-A</h1>
          <p>
            Rachel has lived in Germany for 20 years, where she developed and
            ran a successful mental health practice. Having recently relocated
            to Charleston, Rachel is excited to pick-up where she left off in
            Germany: offering excellent therapeutic support to adults, families,
            and children. Fluent in English, German, and Hebrew, Rachel brings a
            culturally sensitive, client-centered approach to therapy, helping
            clients navigate a wide range of emotional and psychological
            difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rachel holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and Sociology from
            Tel Aviv-Yaffo Academic College, a Master’s Degree in Psychology
            from Humboldt University Berlin, and has completed advanced training
            in Person-Centred Counseling for children and adolescents through
            the German Society for Person-Centred Psychotherapy and Counseling.
            She has extensive experience in both private practice and clinical
            settings, having worked at the Helios Klinikum Berlin Buch
            children’s hospital and in foster care programs for traumatized
            children. Rachel's therapeutic approach is trauma-informed, focusing
            on issues such as developmental trauma, emotional disorders,
            anxiety, and depression. Whether helping clients with personal
            growth, relationship difficulties, or emotional regulation, Rachel
            fosters a safe, empathetic space for healing and self-discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, Rachel loves spending time with her husband and
            children, whether it's exploring nature, enjoying the beach, or
            making the most of their busy family schedule. Since moving to
            Charleston, she has fallen in love with the city—and the sun, sun,
            sun! Rachel finds the sunny weather offers the perfect setting to
            enjoy outdoor activities and make the most of every bright day with
            her family. When she finds a moment of quiet, Rachel enjoys
            reading—whether it’s professional literature to expand her knowledge
            or novels that help her unwind and find inspiration.
