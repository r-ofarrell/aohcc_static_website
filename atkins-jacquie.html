          <h1>Jacquie Atkins, LPC</h1>
          <p>
            Jacquie is a licensed professional counselor who holds a Master of
            Science degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling – Psychology and
            a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services, both from Evangel
            University in Springfield, MO.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jacquie specializes in attachment-based work with teens, families,
            individuals, and couples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jacquie began her clinical work in 2013 working with children within
            the foster system. During this time, she was honored to provide
            support and guidance to foster children, their birth parents, and
            their foster families. In walking alongside children and their
            biological and foster families, Jacquie saw the deep impact that
            trauma has on families. At the same time, she got to witness
            firsthand how facilitating healthy attachments for children, teens,
            and adults could bring significant healing into individuals and
            family-systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October of 2020, Jacquie began pursuing advanced training in
            Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT). Jacquie utilizes EFT and other
            evidence-based approaches to help families grow closer together and
            heal from trauma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jacquie is a wife and mother of two adult sons. In her spare time
            she enjoys traveling, reading and learning.
